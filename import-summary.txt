ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .gitattributes
* .gitignore
* NOTICE.txt
* lib/
* lib/AndroidHiddenAPI.jar
* logo.ai
* logo.png
* logo_transparent.png
* tools/
* tools/sign.bat
* tools/signapk.jar
* tools/testkey.pk8
* tools/testkey.x509.pem

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => app/src/main/assets/
* libs/StickyListHeaders-d7f6fc.jar => app/libs/StickyListHeaders-d7f6fc.jar
* libs/android-support-v13.jar => app/libs/android-support-v13.jar
* libs/libsuperuser-185868.jar => app/libs/libsuperuser-185868.jar
* lint.xml => app/lint.xml
* proguard-project.txt => app/proguard-project.txt
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
